First, we will witness the emergence of 5G wireless mobile networks, which will begin to replace the current 4G networks as early as 2020, enabling new applications and paradigm shifts in edge computing, such as uploading sensor data for AI applications everywhere. Second, cyber security, and in particular its relation to networking and supply chain security for 5G network infrastructure, will receive unprecedented attention from industry.  Third, blockchain technology, which has powered Bitcoin, is creating a new trusted network infrastructure that will allow information to be distributed but not copied. While these areas are each rich in intellectual content on their own, they will also interplay with one other, creating interesting opportunities for those versed in all three.  In order to play a role in this era of network-based computing, students must have a thorough understanding of these networking technologies and applications. Beyond teaching the basic networking protocols, which have become very mature and can be treated as a black box, in CS 143, we will teach new networking issues and topics of significance. This focus on upcoming wireless, cyber security as it relates to networks, network infrastructure, and the broader supply chain, and blockchain advancements is the motivation for CS 143 this semester.  Students in the course will read and discuss basic material as well as the latest literature, work on homework assignments, gain hands-on experience through network programming, and have the opportunity to present the concepts and insights learned through a final project.",Computer Science

The objective can be for high-­‐performance computing and energy-­‐efficient computing (“green” data center servers as well as small embedded devices). In this course, students will learn principled methods of mapping prototypical computations used in machine learning, the Internet of Things, and scientific computing onto parallel and distributed compute nodes of various forms. These techniques will lay the foundation for future computational libraries and packages for both high-­‐performance computing and energy-­‐efficient devices. To master the subject, students will need to appreciate the close interactions between computational algorithms, software abstractions, and computer organizations. After having successfully taken this course, students will acquire an integrated understanding of these issues. The class will be organized into the following modules: Big picture: use of parallel and distributed computing to achieve high performance and energy efficiency; End-­‐to-­‐end example 1: mapping nearest neighbor computation onto parallel computing units in the forms of CPU, GPU, ASIC and FPGA; Communication and I/O: latency hiding with prediction, computational intensity, lower bounds; Computer architectures and implications to computing: multi-­‐cores, CPU, GPU, clusters, accelerators, and virtualization; End-­‐to-­‐end example 2: mapping convolutional neural networks onto parallel computing units in the forms of CPU, GPU, ASIC, FPGA and clusters; Great inner loops and parallelization for feature extraction, data clustering and dimension reduction: PCA, random projection, clustering (K-­‐means, GMM-­‐EM), sparse coding (K-­‐SVD), compressive sensing, FFT, etc.; Software abstractions and programming models: MapReduce (PageRank, etc.), GraphX/Apache Spark, OpenCL and TensorFlow; Advanced topics: autotuning and neuromorphic spike-­‐based computing.  Students will learn the subject through lectures/quizzes, programming assignments, labs, research paper presentations, and a final project.  Students will have latitude in choosing a final project they are passionate about. They will formulate their projects early in the course, so there will be sufficient time for discussion and iterations with the teaching staff, as well as for system design and implementation. Industry partners will support the course by giving guest lectures and providing resources.  The course will use server clusters at Harvard as well as external resources in the cloud.

408,"This course covers advanced topics in data visualization. Over the course of the semester, we will examine seminal works and recent state-of-the-art research in information visualization, scientific visualization and visual analytics. Students will work on a semester-long visualization project that will allow them to visualize their own data sets and write a short paper about their project. We will employ peer-feedback and formal design critiques to analyze each other's work.",Computer Science

415,"This year only: We’ll focus on making communication with computers more accessible: easier, faster, and safer. The course co-locates two advanced graduate seminars in HCI and PL. From HCI, students will learn new design and evaluation methods focused on utility and usability. From PL, students will learn new PL techniques relevant to building user-centric systems.",Computer Science
416,"Students enrolled in 252r will select and present papers on PL topics including type systems, program synthesis, and metaprogramming. Students enrolled in 279 will select and present systems HCI papers about communicating intent between humans and computers, such as programming by demonstration and representing transformations on large piles of data. Activities will include a small number of lectures, discussion of relevant literature in each field, and a project, in which students from 252 and 279 will work together in groups to propose and carry out research at the intersection of PL and HCI.",Computer Science

437,"As machine learning models are increasingly being employed to aid decision makers in high-stakes settings such as healthcare and criminal justice, it is important to ensure that the decision makers (end users) correctly understand and consequent trust the functionality of these models. This graduate level course aims to familiarize students with the recent advances in the emerging field of explainable ML. In this course, we will review seminal position papers of the field, understand the notion of model interpretability from the perspective of decision makers (end users), discuss in detail different classes of interpretable models (e.g., case (prototype) based approaches, sparse linear models, rule-based techniques, saliency maps, generalized additive models, and counterfactual explanations), and explore the connections between model interpretability and causality, debugging, and fairness. The course will also emphasize on various applications which can immensely benefit from model interpretability including medical imaging and judicial decision making.",Computer Science

444,"This course will take a deep dive into batch reinforcement learning, with a focus on healthcare applications.  Sequential decision making is at the core of many healthcare problems: a clinician observes a patient, determines a treatment, and based on the response and the patient's previous history, determines what to try next.  Reinforcement learning is a formal framework for thinking about such problems.  Batch reinforcement learning aims to extract as much as possible from previously-observed trajectories: given a large batch of previous clinician-patient interactions, what inferences can we make about good courses of action?  What inferences are not possible?",Computer Science
445,"We will first review the fundamentals through lectures, readings, and coding assignments; they will also engage in a semester-long project applying and extending these ideas to problems related to healthcare (including the opportunity to work with clinical decision-making in intensive care units).",Computer Science

1867,"Multi-disciplinary course for students interested in designing products and services that are simple, irresistible, delightful, cool, covetable, viral, and, increasingly these days, much more likely to be successful. Students study real world cases of how organizations (e.g., Apple, Gucci, Swarovski) strategically design for desirability. In weekly design challenges, students use analogical transfer to apply these insights to diverse industries and target markets (e.g., health literacy campaigns, declining technologies, the future of luxury). Weekly critique panels with experts enable students to develop their own design point of view and to finish with a diverse design portfolio.",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering

In this course we will study the production, properties, and characterization of these molecules through the lens of food fermentation. In particular, we will focus on the small molecules that contribute taste and aroma in fermented foods. Students will experience the scientific inquiry process in a creative way by designing and implementing their own research project based on a fermented food of their choosing. Still a field with much potential for discovery, interested students are invited to continue their research project in the summer.",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering

1881,"As citizens in a rapidly changing world facing increasingly complex challenges, the skills that tomorrow’s leaders need are increasingly crossing disciplinary silos. Humanity’s most pressing problems are interconnected, involve competing interests, and defy simplification into single disciplines.  Reductionist approaches focused on linear understanding must be balanced against the integrative logic of systems-oriented thinking.  Depth must be balanced with breadth.",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering
1882,"This course will give students an appreciation for the complexities of today’s most intractable problems, and in so doing, help students develop a methodology for navigating the world they will face.  After an overview of systems thinking and its emphasis on interconnections and feedback loops, the course will explore several issues and the complications they generate.  Over the course of the semester, topics including epidemics, inequality, human displacement, and food systems will be addressed.",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering
1883,"The course will employ multiple methods of learning, with course preparation varying from reading novels to watching videos to reviewing academic papers. Each case will include an overview of the issue and why it matters, before exploring existing disciplinary approaches to address the challenge. Prior thinking is evaluated both in terms of its rigor and is effectiveness.  What worked and didn’t work? Why?",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering
1884,"Students will learn to employ systems thinking using a multi-disciplinary method to evaluate possible solutions.  This future-oriented analysis will emphasize the necessity to zoom out and paint a mosaic of possible unintended consequences and roadblocks that may impede progress. By the end of the course, students should have developed a robust framework for integrating economic, political, technical, ethical, and social lenses into an analysis of complex problems and their potential solutions.",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering

Readings, lectures, and discussions will explore issues such as how technology should be regulated, how individual and societal values should be weighed against each other, and how risk-benefit analysis should be applied.

2395,"This course identifies and analyzes alternative solutions to the dilemmas that disruptive technology is posing to public good in the digital, biotech, and jobs and training domains. The objective is for students to craft technologically-informed practical public-private approaches to some of the key policy issues of our time. It begins with a brief history of successful and unsuccessful governance of far-reaching technological changes in the past. The first part of the course treats the ongoing digital revolution, crafting solutions to issues of social media responsibility, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI).  It then turns to the biotech revolution that is gathering momentum, addressing genome editing, bioweapons and bioterror, and the role of venture capital in biotech. The third segment of the course addresses the ways that technology is disrupting the nature of work and lifelong training. The example of driverless cars will be used to illustrate the challenges and opportunities that technology provides to sustain cohesive and prosperous societies in the era of tech ""disruption"". Assignments stress development of key writing and speaking skills.",Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering

This course will be split into two segments: first half will be computational physics of solids and computational quantum chemistry, and the second half will focus on computational physics of fields including light-matter interactions and transport. Our mission is simple: how do we compute properties of quantum materials and their response to light, temperature and external perturbations? We will note that properties of complex systems frequently involve going beyond conventional DFT approaches. In these cases, it is important to go from formalism and approximations to exactly how these are implemented and to recognize where beyond leading-order terms become essential to capture the physics. Whether you are an experimentalist working on low dimensional systems and topological matter or a theorist looking to expand your toolkit, this class is for you!",Applied Physics

3057,In this course we explore advanced practical data science practices. The course will be divided into three major topics:,Applied Computation
3058,"1) How to scale a model from a prototype (often in jupyter notebooks) to the cloud. In this module, we cover virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines before learning about microservices and Kupernetes. Along the way, students will be exposed to Dask.",Applied Computation
3059,"2) How to use existing models for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This can be very important, given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and given the huge jumps in skill that these models can provide to related problems. In this part of the course we will examine various pre-existing models and techniques in transfer learning.",Applied Computation
3060,3) In the third part we will be introducing a number of intuitive visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of models. We will be demonstrating a number of visualization tools ranging from the well established (like saliency maps) to recent ones that have appeared in,Applied Computation

By requiring students to complete a substantial and challenging collaborative project, the capstone course will prepare students for the professional world and ensure that they are trained to conduct research. There will be no homework or lectures. Students will be dealing with real-world problems, messy data sets, and the chance to work on an end-to-end solution to a problem using computational methods.",Applied Computation

3184,"Multi-disciplinary course for students interested in designing products and services that are simple, irresistible, delightful, cool, covetable, viral, and, increasingly these days, much more likely to be successful. Students study real world cases of how organizations (e.g., Apple, Gucci, Swarovski) strategically design for desirability. In weekly design challenges, students use analogical transfer to apply these insights to diverse industries and target markets (e.g., health literacy campaigns, declining technologies, the future of luxury). Weekly critique panels with experts enable students to develop their own design point of view and to finish with a diverse design portfolio.",Environmental Science & Engineering
